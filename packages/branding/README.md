# Taiko branding

This package contains all the branding assets for Taiko.

## Naming

For naming, we use Taiko or Taiko Labs. For the handle, we refer to Taiko with `taikoxyz`, which is where you can find us (ie. twitter: @taikoxyz, github: @taikoxyz). Please maintain this convention.

## Logos

Use SVG and PNG where you can, as the image quality is better.

## Fonts

Taiko uses Oxanium as the global font across its identity. The font is licensed under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) and its specimen and files can be accessed at: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium
